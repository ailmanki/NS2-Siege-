can you make an ingame player vote to give the option to reduce door timer to 1min? standing 5min before the door doing nothing is boring

Some suggestions for siege
- Increase marine default IPs, maybe put to 5 as default
- Give marines med circles like we have it in vanilla
- Increase JP fuel (x2?)



# Broken Maps
## sg_descent
You can use a vent to circumvent the front door entirely. Was able to set up a gorge tunnel just outside of marine main before the door was open.

## sg_eclipse
There’s a vent that leads to outside of the map. Marines couldn’t get in the comm chair and the hive disappeared on aliens.
